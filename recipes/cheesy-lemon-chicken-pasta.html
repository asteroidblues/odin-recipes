        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
            <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese, cubed and softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes, adding frozen peas during the last 2 minutes of cooking time. Drain pasta and peas, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and onion; cook until mushrooms are brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Cook in the same skillet over medium-high heat until browned and no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms back to the skillet. Add cream cheese, lemon juice, and lemon zest; stir until cream cheese is melted. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Fold in Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses, then parsley. Toss with pasta and peas, adding reserved cooking liquid as necessary to make a sauce.</li>
        </ol>
